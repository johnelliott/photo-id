UX experiment: could images be usernames or passwords?

The idea of this one is to use an image, screenshotted, downloaded etc.

Example use case:
1. User wants to return to their stuff
2. qr generated with username or just a random id hash
3. saved to mobile phone or image downloaded
4. user submits the QR image or screenshot back to the app
